/// JavaScript Data Types Quiz
 
//1  
its the vlue of Number

//2
with double quotes or SVGTextPositioningElement
 
//3
the undefined is when the verible has no value by js system and null is when 
the programer is setting the verible to no value

//4 
using typeof operetor

//5
the output will be 2.5

//6
boolean

//7

= {} what the inside { } is an Object

//8
its a Number. its result that is not a valid Number.

//9
== (Loose Equality): Compares values after type coercion.
=== (Strict Equality): Compares both values and types without type coercion.

//10
number("and what inside here")
 
//11
 String, "53"

 //12 
 let verible= 'the type of you wanna check'\
 then u check if its giving an true result (=== the specific type)

 //13
 using back tips ``

 //14

the single and double quutes are the same use.
the back tics used to Functionally  and multiline strings

//15
to convert number to a use function toString()
let

//16 
Object

//17
?

//18
it will just add the number to the end of the strings

//19
true, boolean

//20
using back slash

//21
var is function can be redesgined in blocks while let and const cant.
the const cant be changed unless u doing a function to change it.

//22
let verible;
if {(verible=== undefined)
    console.log ("undefined")
}

//23

//24
true, false or boolen Expression like ===, <,>

//25
the primitive data types are sent to memory as they are
while the object sent to the memory as multi Reference.
